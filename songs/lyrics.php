							I want to know You, Jesus<br />
							I want You to look me in the eyes and say<br />
							Well done, faithful one<br />
							Come, know peace<br />
						</span>
						<br />
						To walk in a way that's pleasing to You<br />
						That's worthy of the call<br />
						All that I have, I give it to You<br />
						To magnify Your name<br />
						Magnify, magnify, to magnify Your name<br />
						Magnify, magnify<br />
