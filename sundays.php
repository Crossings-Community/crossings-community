				<h2>Sunday Mornings</h2>
				<h3>Teaching</h3>
				<p>Central to our worship of the Lord at Crossings is the teaching of God's Word. We believe that "All Scripture is God-breathed, and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness." II Timothy 3:16. In other words, it is valuable and relevant for every aspect of our lives, and equips us to be radical for Him in the world that we live in! Our desire is to teach the whole counsel of God, "both in season and out of season." Though it is at times unpopular, we are committed to in-depth study of God's Word in the Bible, both in book studies and topical series. Truly God's Word is "a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path." We pray that when you come to Crossings you are truly fed and changed by God's Word, which transcends both time and culture and speaks to us right where we are. Trevor Zink and Isaac Zamora are Crossings' primary teachers on Sunday mornings. Look for their <a href="sermons.php">sermons online</a>.</p>
				<h3>Worship</h3>
				<p>Worship is much more than a song sung in a heart of thanksgiving and praise. We believe it is a lifestyle that we live. Every act of obedience, every act of service, everytime we submit a thought to Christ we add a note to the life-song of worship we compose. This song, composed throughout our lives, ultimately will be given to the Lord, hopefully to His great pleasure. It is a song inspired by His love, conducted by His Spirit, made perfect in His Son. We are passionate about song. We embrace mixing the old with the new. Sometimes it's too loud, sometimes it's too quiet. We strive to be authentic in our musical expression of worship. Check out some clips to get a feel for it. We look forward to worshipping our great God with you.</p>
				<h3>Ambiance</h3>
				<p>We try to keep things fresh at Crossings, in every way, including the setting in which we fellowship and worship. We feel that the environment or ambiance at Crossings has the ability to help or hinder, so we set it in such a way as to help us focus and meditate on our Lord during worship and teaching. The ambiance also sets the tone for fellowship at Crossings. During fellowship before and after worship and teaching, we want people to feel "at home," and free to come early or stay later in order to connect with each other.</p>
				<h3>Stones</h3>
				<p>We all worship and serve in different ways, because God has granted us all different abilities and passions. There are those of us who love to worship God through "art", which can be an expression in the form of photography, paintings, poetry, digital media, etc. These creations are symbols of what God has done in our hearts and in our lives. We want to share these acts of worship with the rest of the community by placing them around the room when we come together on Sunday mornings, in hopes that they will inspire others to worship and serve in the same way. We decided to call this ministry "Stones" based on the following inspiring passage: Joshua 4:5-7 ..."Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?' tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD . When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.</p>
				<h3>Care</h3>
				<p>At Crossings part of our vision is to be an authentic, caring community... Just like the early church was.. Acts 2:42-47, specifically vs. 45, "and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need." We want to be that kind of community. This care presents itself in many ways.. Meals for families (due to births, losses of jobs, etc), providing Crossings Care-Baskets to newcomers, hospitality on a Sunday morning (greeting and talking with people.. making all feel welcome), lending a helping hand to anyone moving or needing help fixing up their house. There are numerous ways that we can care for one another. So if you would like to get involved, or if you need care (don't be shy!), please contact one of us at Crossings. We would love to hear from you! God bless.</p>
