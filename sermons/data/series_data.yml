        series: Thou Art The Christ | A Study in the Book of Matthew
        title: Introduction
        summary: Matthew 1:1-17 - Matthew's gospel was written to a Jewish audience or those who had an understanding of Judaism. He opens his gospel with a presentation of his subject, Jesus who is the Christ. He then sets the tone for his gospel by starting on his mission to prove that Jesus is the promised Messiah. The starting point of his evidence is the foundational, provable fact that Jesus is the Son of David, the Son of Abraham. In going through the â€œlegalâ€ genealogy of Jesus, Matthew intentionally names many â€œscandalousâ€ individuals who are known for lying, adultery, murder, prostitution, incest, wickedness, displeasing God, or being a Gentile. While the Jewish leaders of the time would scoff at a person from such a background, Matthew confidently says, in his own way, "Behold the Savior".

        title: God is With Us...
        summary: Matthew 1:18-25 - In this second message we are confronted with one of the most foundational, yet most profound statements of Christianity. This Jesus who Matthew makes every effort to show is the Son of Abraham and the Son of David is also the Son of God, or "Immanuel, God with us". This is an amazing statement, but if we are not careful we can glance over it with little or no impact on us. The aim of this message is not only to ground believers in the foundational truth that Jesus was born fully God and fully man through the miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit, but to be blown away and encouraged with the fact that Jesus is "Immanuel, God with us!"

        title: Authentic Worship
        summary: Matthew 2:1-12 - As Matthew continues on in his presentation of Jesus as the Messiah, he evidences various principles of authentic worship. The Gentile magi travelled a great distance as they were directed to the Savior by God, openly proclaimed in Jerusalem that Jesus was the King of the Jews, had an intimate heart-level connection with the Savior, unashamedly worshiped the Savior, and presented Him with gifts of their treasures. Matthew shows us by the magi's example how we are to respond to the truth of who Jesus is.

        title: No Ordinary Child
        summary: Matthew 2:13-23 - In this familiar passage the gospel writer continues to build his case for the reality that Jesus is the Messiah. He gives compelling evidence from  Jesus' early infancy that He is no ordinary child. Fulfilled prophesies as well as Herod's intense assault against the infant combine with divine guidance and protection to force the reader to consider that something significant is taking place...God himself has shown up!

        title: The Temptations of Christ
        summary: Matthew 4:1-11 - Matthew continues documenting the facts establishing that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah. Immediately following the public proclamation by the Father that Jesus is His beloved Son, Jesus is escorted into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil. Jesus is tempted for 40 days while fasting. Matthew documents three specific temptations that occur after Jesus had been fasting for 40 days. The devil tempts Jesus in the areas of physical needs, misapplication of the Word of God, and with power and possessions. Jesus's responses to the temptations come from Scripture. Though Jesus never excused Himself from the human experience during the temptations, He was without sin, one of the essential proofs of His ability to be the perfect sacrifice for our sins.

        title: Kingdom of the Broken
        summary: Matthew 4:23-5:3 - Jesus Christ, the King of the Universe invites broken people to enter His kingdom so that   He can heal them and teach them. He is on a recruitment campaign to populate His kingdom with people who like you and me, who need help. This is Good news! This is the Gospel. In this message we will unpack the assumption that Jesus is in fact the Ultimate and Supreme Authority of the universe as it was demonstrated in His ministry and teaching. Second we will unpack the reality that this supreme authority of the Universe really is seeking after broken people to be in His kingdom.

        title: The Beatitudes
        summary: Matthew 5:2-12 - Jesus teaches His disciples about the requirements for living as His disciple. He starts His requirements with the beatitudes, the basic priciples by which all of His disciples must live. It is clear that we cannot meet these standards and should be convicted by them. However, Jesus has lived up to the standards on our behalf and His sacrifice is sufficient for our shortcomings as will become evident later in our study of Matthew.

        summary: Matthew 5:13-16 - After Jesus lays out the beatitudes, the general description of those fit for the kingdom of God, He tells His disciples how those who evidence the beatitudes from the heart will impact this world. Jesus's true disciples will be salt by acting as a preservative of the earth and bringing the flavors of joy, peace, grace, and the abundant life to people called into the kingdom. Jesus's true disciples will be light by exposing the darkness of this world while revealing God's righteousness.

        summary: Matthew 5:17-26 - There is a "surpassing righteousness"    that is necesary for entrance into the kingdom of heaven. The sobering reality is that we don't have this righteousness. The good news is that Jesus does!  In this message we will examine Jesus statement in regard to the law and prophets    "I did not come to abolish but to fulfill" and see how this is both bad news and good news for sinners

        summary: Matthew 5:27-37 - Jesus continues with his explanation of the righteous expectation for kingdom living. As Jesus proclaims the intended higher standard for kingdom living, He challenges the Pharisees' perversion of the Law respecting adultery, divorce, and oaths. Jesus provides His disciples with the Law's intended meaning (the spirit of the Law), which was contrary to the legalistic standard that was taught by the Pharisees.

        title: Seeking the Reward of the Father
        summary: Matthew 6:1-18 - In this passage we are confronted with a  warning from Jesus "Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them...otherwise you will have no reward with your Father who is in heaven". It is a sobering reality that we often times miss out on the Fathers reward because we have settled instead for the honor of men. But it is encouraging to realize that when disregard the recognition of man, Father who sees all rewards us according to his greatness and glory.

        title: Practicing Prayer
        summary: Matthew 6:5-14 - In the midst of Jesus teaching His disciples not to practice their righteousness to be seen my men, He gives us a working model for prayer. Using this as a springboard, we examine what Scripture says about the importance of prayer. Understanding what prayer is and the character of the One to whom we are praying, should cause us to pray with expectancy, knowing that God will hear us and will always answer for our good and His glory.

        summary: Matthew 6:19-24 - In this passage Jesus commands us to stop "laying up treasures on earth" and to start "laying up treasure in heaven". He concludes with the sober warning "you cannot serve God and mammon". In the first part of this two-part message we will examine why this is so important for the Christian, who is to be marked with a zeal for good works, and how we are to do this. Next week we will examine the primary hurdle to unleashing our resources to be used by God.

Jesus addresses this issue in the Sermon on the Mount when he commands us to stop laying up treasure on earth and lay up treasure in heaven. In this message we examine Jesus follow up command to "stop be anxious for your life" and the accompanying commands to help us overcome this primary hurdle to us being the kind of people who are unleashed to be generous in meeting the needs of those less fortunate.

In His teaching Jesus (1) confronts our hypocrisy of being judgmental unnecessarily, (2) cautions us about some people's unwillingness to be corrected in anything (3) gives us hope that our Father will help us become less judgmental and (4) gives us the Golden Rule, which should affect every area of our lives.

He then says only those who endure will be saved. To help His disciples endure, Jesus provides them with the encouragements and promises that (1) everything they will experience He will experience, (2) there is no need to fear, and (3) rewards await for our participation in the mission.

While John the Baptist is imprisoned, he asks the question of Jesus if He is the one to be expected. Jesus answers not in words, but in deeds, "The blind receive sight and the lame walk, the lepers are healed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he who does not take offense at Me."

        title: God's Sovereignty, Man's Responsibility
        summary: Matthew 11:15-30 - Jesus describes God's sovereignty coupled with man's responsibility in the area of salvation using the examples of his "generation" and the cities in which most of His miracles were performed, who failed to properly respond with repentance to the message of John the Baptist and Jesus. Jesus describes the Father as the one who hides the truth of the gospel from the "wise and prudent" of this world while revealing it to "babes". Though God is sovereign over man's salvation, Jesus concludes his teaching with an open invitation to come to Him, clearly demonstrating man's responsibility and accountability in the area of salvation.

        summary: This series culminates in answering the fundamental question of what it means to follow Jesus. This was the call on all disciples of Jesus's day and it is His call on our lives today. Taking the background and principles developed in the first five weeks of this series, we find 10 practical principles for what it means to follow Jesus.

        title: An Issue Corrected
        summary: Acts 6:1-7 - Early in the church, structure and roles emerge and become very critical to the ongoing success and unity of the church. This is evidenced as the early church enlists wise and spirit filled servants (men) to deal with a problem surronding the neglect of widows, which threatened the unity and integrity of the church. The principles in establishing the servant role in Acts 6 in many ways are the foundation of the deacon role established by Paul in I Timothy 3. Tonight, we're going to dive into the deacon role and its importance to the church.

        summary: Building on key first principles of the faith (belief in the gospel, enfolding of believers into a local body, â€˜household' order), the apostles instruct the churches about their participation in the Great Commission.Â    The message of the gospel of Christ is to be communicated by every member of the body.Â Some will receive the calling, through the commissioning of the church, to preach the gospel and establish churches in a context beyond their local community.Â Others (most) are called to carry the message of the gospel â€“ to live lives consistent with sound doctrine and to share (verbally) the gospel message as such times avail themselves â€“ in the context of the web of their relationships.Â   Those in the local context are to simultaneously support the work of those called to minister extra-locally.

        title: Crossings Retreat, 2009
        summary: Our occupations (wage earning) and our interactions with the community (outside of our church body), are significant categories in the spectrum of our "one life". The apostles provided specific instructions, consistent with principles of wise living described by Scripture as a whole, to the early churches with regard to these categories. As we have come to realize more clearly, our occupations and our interactions with the secular community are interconnected with other "one life" categories (e.g. our family, our family of families, etc.), and all of these are defined and informed by our love for Christ and the overarching priority of the progress of the gospel.
