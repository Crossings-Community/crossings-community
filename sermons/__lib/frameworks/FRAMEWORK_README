Frameworks
----------


These are collections of scripts loosely bound together into a framework.
The code doesn't know the framework name space so this is purely for our easy of understanding and management.

If ini.php is calling "Constantize::defineConstantsForEachFramework();" then each framework file name will be defined as a constant <FRAMEWORK_NAME>_FRAMEWORK that way we can load up a framework by doing require(STRING_FRAMEWORK); for the string framework.

Another nice thing about the frameworks is that the classes that make up the framework are placed in the frameworks' directory, upon loading the framework all these files/classes are loaded as well. I guess there is now no reason not to have each class be its own file....
