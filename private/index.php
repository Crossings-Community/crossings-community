					<h2>2012 Self and Family Assessment</h2>
					<p>Please pray and converse with others as appropriate about the following questions:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>What is your goal for 2012 to become a better spouse?</li>
						<li>What is your goal for 2012 to become a better parent?</li>
						<li>How many Seek the Welfare opportunities will you attend in 2012?</li>
						<li>What will you do to make sure you are regularly contributing to the Sunday and midweek gatherings?</li>
						<li>Men - Will you commit to pray out loud in our Sunday gathering at least once per month?</li>
						<li>What is your goal for contributing to the Crossings general fund in 2012?</li>
						<li>What is your goal for contributing to other Crossings initiatives in 2012 (Pauline Team, Cambodia, Family Fund, etc.)?</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We want to talk to you about your specific responses to each of the above questions, with the exception of the final two, when we connect with you sometime before the end of the year. With regard to the financial questions, for now, what we want to do is get a sense as to what the total amount is for the entire body without knowing the specifics from anyone. Be thinking about this and we'll let you know how we plan on gathering this information.</p>
					<p>I hope everyone knows that there is no self-interest in any of the things we are requesting, and that we are responding to what we believe is God's call on us as leaders to help build the body up.</p>
