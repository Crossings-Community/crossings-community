		<h2>Notes:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you need to borrow pans/bowls from other houses, please label them and make sure they get returned.</li>
			<li>Use the refrigerator in your assigned house to store your food for your meal (including the leftovers).</li>
			<li>Do not leave any leftover food from your meal after the retreat is concluded.</li>
			<li>Please be considerate with your portion size when serving up food. Wait on seconds until after everyone has had a chance to eat.</li>
			<li>If you are on "Meal Duty", you are also on Garbage and Clean up Detail. Please locate the garbage bags and remove them.</li>
			<li>Crossings will reimburse the expenses for the drinks &amp; paper products. If you are signed up for "Other needs" it would be very helpful if you would maintain them throughout the weekend. (keep drinks and coolers stocked &amp; cleaned up, organize supplies...)</li>
			<li>Meal Planning tips: Please keep the food as simple as possible. Try to bring food that is already mostly prepared and/or easy to assemble. Family-friendly foods work best. Plan your meal to feed about 48 adults and 22 children.</li>
			<li>Those preparing the meal are also responsible for clean up. Please try not to store the food for your meal in the meeting house.</li>
			<li>Feel free to bring a snack to share for the weekend. (munchies, cookies, fruit &amp; veggies, cheese &amp; crackers, etc.)</li>
			<li>For those coming up on Thursday, the organized meals don't start until Friday dinner, so plan accordingly.</li>
		</ul>
