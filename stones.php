				<h2>Stones</h2>
				<p>We all worship and serve in different ways, because God has granted us all different abilities and passions. There are those of us who love to worship God through "art", which can be an expression in the form of photography, paintings, poetry, digital media, etc. These creations are symbols of what God has done in our hearts and in our lives. We want to share these acts of worship with the rest of the community by placing them around the room when we come together on Sunday mornings, in hopes that they will inspire others to worship and serve in the same way.</p>
				<p>We decided to call this ministry "Stones" based on the following inspiring passage: Joshua 4:5-7 ..."Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, 6 to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?' 7 tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD . When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever...</p>
